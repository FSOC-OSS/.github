# Welcome to FSOC OSS
🚀 Jumpstart your Open Source Journey!

FSOC is a week-long immersive program starting this October, tailored to introduce first-year students to the world of open-source development. All you need is curiosity and the passion to learn—no prior experience required! 💡

## How FSOC OSS Works:
Claim Issues, Challenge Yourself: Forget what you already know! Instead of looking for issues you can easily solve, we encourage you to tackle those you don’t. This is where growth happens—dive into the unknown, and learn by doing! 🚀

Solve with Support: Once you’ve claimed an issue, it’s time to roll up your sleeves. Explore solutions, consult mentors, and when in doubt—Google is your best friend! Remember, the journey is as important as the destination. 

Open Your First Pull Request: After hours of learning, debugging, and maybe a little frustration with Git (we’ve all been there 😉), it’s time to submit your pull request. This is the moment where you’ll feel the thrill of contributing to real projects!

Rise Through the Ranks: With every merged pull request, you’ll climb the leaderboard, earn points, and—after some sleepless nights—experience that fleeting but magical moment: “I love programming!” 🎉

## Why Join?
FSOC OSS offers more than just technical skills—it’s a gateway to the open-source community, teamwork, and the real-world experience of building something impactful. Not to mention, it’s a great stepping stone for prestigious programs like GSoC.
